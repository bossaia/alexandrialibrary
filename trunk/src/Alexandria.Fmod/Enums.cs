	[REMARKS]
	To drive the output synchronously, and to disable FMOD's timing thread, use the FMOD_INIT_NONREALTIME flag.
    
	To pass information to the driver when initializing fmod use the extradriverdata parameter for the following reasons.
	<li>FMOD_OutputType_WAVWRITER - extradriverdata is a pointer to a char * filename that the wav writer will output to.
	<li>FMOD_OutputType_WAVWRITER_NRT - extradriverdata is a pointer to a char * filename that the wav writer will output to.
	<li>FMOD_OutputType_DSOUND - extradriverdata is a pointer to a HWND so that FMOD can set the focus on the audio for a particular window.
	<li>FMOD_OutputType_GC - extradriverdata is a pointer to a FMOD_ARAMBLOCK_INFO struct. This can be found in fmodgc.h.
	Currently these are the only FMOD drivers that take extra information.  Other unknown plugins may have different requirements.

	[ENUM]
	[
	[DESCRIPTION]   
	These are Speaker types defined for use with the System::setSpeakerMode / System_SetSpeakerMode or 
	System::getSpeakerMode / System_GetSpeakerMode command.

	[REMARKS]
	These are important notes on Speaker Modes in regards to sounds created with SOFTWARE.
	Note below the phrase 'sound channels' is used.  These are the subchannels inside a sound, they are not related and 
	have nothing to do with the FMOD class "Channel / CHANNEL".
	For example a mono sound has 1 sound channel, a stereo sound has 2 sound channels, and an AC3 or 6 channel wav file have 6 "sound channels".

	FMOD_SpeakerMode_RAW
	---------------------
	This Mode is for output devices that are not specifically mono/streo/5.1 or 7.1, but are multichannel.
	Sound channels map to Speakers sequentially, so a mono sound maps to output Speaker 0, stereo sound maps to output Speaker 0 & 1.
	Multichannel sounds map input channels to output channels 1:1. 
	Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan and Channel::setSpeakerMix / Channel_SetSpeakerMix do not work.
	Speaker levels must be manually set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels / Channel_SetSpeakerLevels.

	SpeakerMode_MONO
	---------------------
	This Mode is for a 1 Speaker arrangement.
	Panning does not work in this Speaker Mode.
	Mono, stereo and multichannel sounds have each sound channel played on the one Speaker unity.
	Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels / Channel_SetSpeakerLevels.
	Channel::setSpeakerMix / Channel_SetSpeakerMix does not work.

	SpeakerMode_STEREO
	-----------------------
	This Mode is for 2 Speaker arrangements that have a left and right Speaker.
	Mono sounds default to an even distribution between left and right.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan.
	Stereo sounds default to the middle, or full left in the left Speaker and full right in the right Speaker.  
	They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan.
	Multichannel sounds have each sound channel played on each Speaker at unity.
	Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels / Channel_SetSpeakerLevels.
	Channel::setSpeakerMix / Channel_SetSpeakerMix works but only left and right parameters are used, the rest are ignored.

	FMOD_SpeakerMode_4POINT1
	------------------------
	This Mode is for 4.1 Speaker arrangements that have a left/right/center/rear and a subwoofer Speaker.
	Mono sounds default to the center Speaker.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan.
	Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.  
	They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan.
	Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each Speaker in order of input.
	Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels.
	Channel::setSpeakerMix works but side left / side right are ignored, and rear left / rear right are averaged.

	SpeakerMode_5POINT1
	------------------------
	This Mode is for 5.1 Speaker arrangements that have a left/right/center/rear left/rear right and a subwoofer Speaker.
	Mono sounds default to the center Speaker.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan.
	Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.  
	They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan.
	Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each Speaker in order of input.  
	Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels / Channel_SetSpeakerLevels.
	Channel::setSpeakerMix / Channel_SetSpeakerMix works but side left / side right are ignored.

	SpeakerMode_7POINT1
	------------------------
	This Mode is for 7.1 Speaker arrangements that have a left/right/center/rear left/rear right/side left/side right 
	and a subwoofer Speaker.
	Mono sounds default to the center Speaker.  They can be panned with Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan.
	Stereo sounds default to the left sound channel played on the front left, and the right sound channel played on the front right.  
	They can be cross faded with Channel::setPan / Channel_SetPan.
	Multichannel sounds default to all of their sound channels being played on each Speaker in order of input.  
	Mix behaviour for multichannel sounds can be set with Channel::setSpeakerLevels / Channel_SetSpeakerLevels.
	Channel::setSpeakerMix / Channel_SetSpeakerMix works and every parameter is used to set the balance of a sound in any Speaker.

	SpeakerMode_PROLOGIC
	------------------------------------------------------
	This Mode is for mono, stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 Speaker arrangements, as it is backwards and forwards compatible with stereo, 
	but to get a surround effect a Dolby Prologic or Prologic 2 hardware decoder / amplifier is needed.
	Pan behaviour is the same as SpeakerMode_5POINT1.

	If this function is called the numoutputchannels setting in System::setSoftwareFormat is overwritten.

	For 3D sounds, panning is determined at runtime by the 3D subsystem based on the Speaker Mode to determine which Speaker the 
	sound should be placed in.

	List of windowing methods used in spectrum analysis to reduce leakage / transient signals intefering with the analysis.
	This is a problem with analysis of continuous signals that only have a small portion of the signal sample (the fft window size).
	Windowing the signal with a curve or triangle tapers the sides of the fft window to help alleviate this problem.

	[REMARKS]
	Cyclic signals such as a sine wave that repeat their cycle in a multiple of the window size do not need windowing.
	I.e. If the sine wave repeats every 1024, 512, 256 etc samples and the FMOD fft window is 1024, then the signal would not need windowing.
	Not windowing is the same as FMOD_DspFFTWindow_RECT, which is the default.
	If the cycle of the signal (ie the sine wave) is not a multiple of the window size, it will cause frequency abnormalities, so a different windowing method is needed.

	Normalize amplifies the sound based on the maximum peaks within the signal.<br>
	For example if the maximum peaks in the signal were 50% of the bandwidth, it would scale the whole sound by 2.<br>
	The lower threshold value makes the normalizer ignores peaks below a certain point, to avoid over-amplification if a loud signal suddenly came in, and also to avoid amplifying to maximum things like background hiss.<br>
	<br>
	Because FMOD is a realtime audio processor, it doesn't have the luxury of knowing the peak for the whole sound (ie it can't see into the future), so it has to process data as it comes in.<br>
	To avoid very sudden changes in volume level based on small samples of new data, fmod fades towards the desired amplification which makes for smooth gain control.  The fadetime parameter can control this.<br>

	[REMARKS]
	This pitch shifting unit can be used to change the pitch of a sound without speeding it up or slowing it down.<br>
	It can also be used for time stretching or scaling, for example if the pitch was doubled, and the frequency of the sound was halved, the pitch of the sound would sound correct but it would be twice as slow.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Warning!</b> This filter is very computationally expensive!  Similar to a vocoder, it requires several overlapping FFT and IFFT's to produce smooth output, and can require around 440mhz for 1 stereo 48khz signal using the default settings.<br>
	Reducing the signal to mono will half the cpu usage, as will the overlap count.<br>
	Reducing this will lower audio quality, but what settings to use are largely dependant on the sound being played.  A noisy polyphonic signal will need higher overlap and fft size compared to a speaking voice for example.<br>
	<br>
	This pitch shifter is based on the pitch shifter code at http://www.dspdimension.com, written by Stephan M. Bernsee.<br>
	The original code is COPYRIGHT 1999-2003 Stephan M. Bernsee <smb@dspdimension.com>.<br>
