@"New Staging Rules

When playing Fog on the Barrow-downs, players reveal encounter cards individually in player order during the Staging step of the Quest phase. If an encounter card has an effect that uses the word 'you' then the encounter card is referring to the player who revealed the card. If the revealed card has the Surge keyword, the player who revealed it reveals an additional card. Encounter cards with the Doomed X keyword still affect each player.

Peril Keyword

When a player reveals an encounter card with the the Peril keyword, he must resolve that staging of that card on his own without conferring with ther other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging.",
                OppositeText =
@"Creating a Staging Area

When a player is instructed to create his own staging area, he sets aside an area in front of himself to serve as his own separate staging area. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the first player, but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are present in the game.

Players cannot affect players or cards that do not share a common staging area. The players as a group still cannot have more than 1 copy of a unique card in play.

During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. Encounter card effects are limited to players and cards at that stage. Effects that reference 'each player' only affect each player at that staging area.",

@"Stage 3B - Lost in the Fog

Stage 3B (and its staging area) must remain in play until it is defeated. If there are no players at stage 3B, skip each phase at that stage.

Combining Staging Areas

When a player is instructed to combine staging areas with another staging area, each enemy and location card in that player's staging area is added to the other staging area. Enemies engaged with a player remain engaged with him.

Immune to Play Card Effects

Cards with the text 'Immune to player card effects' ignore the effects of all player cards. Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects.",
