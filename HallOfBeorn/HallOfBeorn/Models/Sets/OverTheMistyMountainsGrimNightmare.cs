Remove the following cards, in the specified quantities, from both of the standard encounter deck:

2x ~Cave Entrance
2x Lone-lands
2x Dreary ~Hills
2x Overhanging Rock
1x Great Cavern Room
1x The Great ~Goblin
3x ~Goblin Miners
3x ~Goblin Axeman

Then, shuffle the encounter cards in this Nightmare Deck with the Over the Misty Mountains Grim encounter set icons into the remainder of the first encounter deck. Shuffle the cards with The Great ~Goblin encounter set icon into the second encounter deck.

Finally, flip this setup card over and place it next to the quest deck. Its effects remain active throughout the game, which is now ready to begin.",
