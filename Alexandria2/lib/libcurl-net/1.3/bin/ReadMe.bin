This is the README file for binaries. Included in the distribution are the
following four files:

-- libcurl.dll:   This was built with libcurl 7.13.0, openssl-0.9.7e,
                  c-ares-1.2.1 and zlib-1.2.1

-- ca-bundle.crt: Simple certificate bundle for SSL.

-- LibCurlNet.dll: The DLL referenced by your program.

-- LibCurlShim.dll: A DLL used internally by LibCurlNet.dll to interface
                    with libcurl.dll.

Two more notes:

-- If you have Visual Studio 7.1 or higher, you can rebuild LibCurlNet.dll
   and LibCurlShim.dll by opening LibCurlNet.sln in the parent directory.

-- Executables built from the samples directory should go here as well,
   since LibCurlNet.dll is now an unsigned, private assembly.
