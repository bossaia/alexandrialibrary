    <content type='html'>Ok, so here we go again.  I really like to write, but I just never seem to find the time to stay focused.  Right now I'm typing this entry as one of my classes is taking a test.  I'm working full-time as a librarian and teaching three classes in the evening.  It's still fun to teach, but it's also quite tiring.  I never knew how draining it was to perform like that three nights a week.  I can only imagine how it is for comedians and other performers.  I really do feel like what I do is part education and part entertainment.  I know how bored I was in school, so I like to keep my classes a bit more comical and on the entertaining side.  This is helpful, especially when teaching night classes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work still basically is a give and take proposition.  As I have stated before, I really like being a librarian, I just don't necessarily like where I am librarianing at! (Please pardon the grammatical diversion)  I have been interviewing for multiple jobs mainly to keep my feet wet and my intellect stimulated, but there are times I really want to stay where I am and finish the projects I've started.  However, if I keep getting crappy emails from people at work, I'm going to have to get going!  It rarely happens, and honestly this is really the first time I've ever heard anyone complain.  However, they intimated that others were dissatisfied with the time it sometimes takes to get materials to them.  I am trying to rework the tracking of purchases at work to stay on top of things, but sometimes I have no control over timeframes.  One of the shipping departments at a specific location lost a box of five rather large books, but I didn't hear about it for 6 months.  Now I've got someone complaining that I didn't get them some books, which I am sure that I ordered, in three weeks.  I am glad that they notified me, but they were pretty harsh with the wording.  I am doing my best with minimal support and understanding.  I mean, it's not like I'm one person with two assistants trying to support the information needs of a 4000 employee company or anything.  Not to mention that I'm trying to drag my portion of the information network into the 21st century all while the bloody IT department is trying to take over the company and decided who gets to do what.  For goddesses sake, they don't even have an OPAC!  I'm just trying to make things better and all I get is, sorry, but your little library project isn't worthwhile, now go back and shelve some books.  I think that's the biggest problem I have.  Only a very few people respect what I do, and even fewer understand it.  The fact that I report to a pharmacist who only works part-time speaks volumes about how they value my position.  Don't get me wrong, I am happy with my salary, and I love my co-workers, but there is little or no validation of me as an employee.  No one truly seems to understand what I can do for the company, or what the library can do for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That kind of shit really pisses me off, and no matter how many people I talk to, no matte how may emails I send out, and no matter how much I plan improvements, nothing seems to really matter.  Perhaps that is just the way it is at most jobs, but I can't help but feel that there is a job out there where I can feel at least moderately validated as a thinking, breathing human being.  I know that my job at the hospital back in Kansas City gave me a great sense of validation.  I was frequently asked to work on committees, and to share my knowledge and experience in new and interesting ways.  People frequently sought my insight on various problems, library-related or otherwise.  I truly felt like a valuable member of the team.  Now I just feel like a lump of flesh doing just enough to get by and get a raise every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I do at least have the diversion of teaching, or I will as long as I go and get a bloody TB test this week.  My CC is nice, but the rules and attendance taking are growing a bit old.  I feel like a second grade teacher having to take roll every day.  If they don't want to come to class, it's bloody fine with me.  They are all over 18 and are paying their money.  If they think playing xbox is more important that school so be it.  I'm not a bloody kindergarden teacher.  Maybe I'll quit taking roll and just start making that shit up!  Might make my gradesheets look more normal.  Hmmmmmm . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, well enough rant for now.  Maybe my next post will be more of a rave.  I would hate for people to think that I'm that negative.  I really am just a positive person having a bad day!!!!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8677504-112778942212704032?l=bearbrarian.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title type='text'>New Year New, um, er, uh, well . . . </title>
    <content type='html'>
      Ok, so it's a brand new year, but still the same old shit!  Or at least that's the way it seems.  Being a librarian is still high on my list, but I'm finding myself drawn more and more to investing and making money.  Granted I do like having money, and perhaps this is coming from all those years of me using everyone else's money to satisfy my needs, but I really want to invest and make more on my own.  It just has a different feel to it.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I am certainly thankful to all those who have kept me afloat all these years, particularly my mom and grandmother, but now it's my turn to do it on my own.  I guess I've just always been sort of sheltered and waited for people to do things for me.  I never truly realized that I could, or even should venture out and take the bull by the horns.  Folks tell me I'm intelligent and creative, but I don't really see it.  However, it's time to test the waters and see where the tide leads.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Right now I have purchased some stock, not much, but just enough for me to watch the market and feel like a true participant.  I am REALLY interested in alpacas, and would like to try and put together a business prospectus to see about getting some capital to get into that market.  I don't know what the future holds for the alpaca industry, but they seem to be a fairly dynamic and determined group of folks.  I don't really want my own farm at the moment, eventhough I thought that was what I wanted.  For the time being, it would be nice just to buy a female and board her at a local farm.  The prices for a nice female are 25 - 75K, and most come either pregnant or with an option to breed with a particular male.  If she drops a nice cria (baby alpaca), then in a year or so, you have doubled your investment.  Not a bad return, eh?  Plus I like the live nature of the investment and the fact that there is something tangible to visit, pet, help with, etc.  I have a farm picked out, but I just need to figure out the money end!!!  I know several farms do owner financing, so maybe that is the way to go!!
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Life is humming along, and I feel like I'm slowly emerging from the holiday depression I get each year.  We bought a Bowflex Ultimate to start working out at home, and I LOVE IT!!!  It really is a great machine, and as someone who has used all different kinds of equipment, I should know.  I miss freeweights just a little, but I like the concept and the practice with the Bowflex.  It really is quite versatile, and does everything you need.  We went ahead and got the lat tower and leg attachments, as well as the 410 upgrade, and they will be worth it.  It's kind of hard to hold myself back and not just jump into a traditional routine, but I've reading Elliott Darden's book that accompanied the machine, and I am liking what he has to say.  I've always held the thought in the back of my mind, that most motions use multiple muscle groups, and you don't always have to focus just on the biceps to work them well in a workout.  They get plenty of work from the other exercises in the set.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Also, it has been my longstanding experience that less is more.  By this I mean that you don't need to kill yourself in a workout to get results, in fact moderation is the key.  Yes, you need to push limits and increase, but his single exercise/single set theory holds well with what I have experienced in the past.  Another part of this concept is rest.  Yes, if you want to look like the Governator used to look, twice a day in the gym six days a week, and all the steroids you can consume is the best method, but for most folks, the best way is to rest a day between workouts.  I like to take this a bit further and take a week off on occasion.  I have found that that week makes a huge difference and helps me avoid plateaus.  The biggest problem is picking back up and continuing.  Life always seems to find a way to distract you for more than your week, so do it, but be aware that you have to get back at it!!!
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;As for diet, I'm finding it hard to stay very low carb, but I just feel so much better when I don't eat them.  What they say in all of the Atkins stuff is true.  You sleep better, feel better, and have a clearer mind when you cut out the carbs.  My problem is that I'm not a big fan of many of the carbs that are acceptable.  I don't care for fruit all that much, and my vegetable intake, despite having been a vegetarian for 10 years, is still nominal.  Beans - Oy let's not even go there . . .   That leaves me with broccoli, green beans, and a few others.  One thing is for sure, you have to be very creative to be on Atkins.  But, I did lose over 30 lbs, and felt great.  Of course buying the condo last year was an emotional trauma that pushed me off the wagon and added 20 lbs to my physique, but I've taken off another 10, and with the new Bowflex, I hope to keep going and get back into those 36s!
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Atkins really is a great system, and I am dismayed at the naysayers who don't really take the time to understand the approach.  Yes it is somewhat drastic for the first few weeks, but you do begin adding good carbohydrates back into your diet.  At it's heart, it's the same as all other diets.  You need to retrain yourself to eat properly.  We simply consume too many calories from all of the wrong food categories.  Even on Atkins, it's easy to eat too much fried, fatty food.  Yes, you will lose the weight, but it will be even better if you stick to leaner, broiled meats.  I know that for me in my first round, my total serum cholesterol dropped over 70 points, and my LDL/HDL ratio finally balanced to normal.  I haven't checked it this year, but I'd wager it's out of whack again.  All I can say is that it's hard to do no matter what diet you choose, but it isn't going to happen if you don't apply yourself to it each and every day.  It's not a lifetime sentence, and you will find a good balance, but you need to take the weight of first, and then add stuff back in as long as you maintain.  Besides, most of the food is great, and you don't really end up with a plate full of meat and fat like most critics say.  You have well-rounded meals with lots of lean meats, cheeses, vegetables, and a few goodies.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I made a low-carb pumpkin pie last week, and it was great!!  Even Scott liked it.  He said it was the best he'd ever had, and I can tell you that when he asks for a slice for himself that it's good.  He's very finicky, and won't touch anything even remotely distasteful.  I'll have to post the recipe this week!
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Well - Happy New Year to all!

      Ok, so today I get a call from the CC wanting me to teach an honors cultural anthro class!  Exactly what I want to do, and now my interest in teaching is piqued even more!  Maybe I should look at full-time teaching jobs.  The problem is I know that there are a shitload of PhDs out there ready to swoop in and take them away.  I know I would love the schedule, but it's a bit of a drastic change - AGAIN!
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I'm beginning to think there is someone out there in the wider world controlling my life, and the bastard has a sick sense of humor.  It's like the tastiest carrot ever grown is being dangled before me, and I can't get anywhere near it!  I'm getting tired of looking for signs and not having a legend to read them when they appear.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;On another disheartening note, my pup Lucky has an infected hygroma.  Now until yesterday I knew nothing about this, but have found out in short order that they are common in large dogs, and can be either easy to treat, or a real pain.  In short, the pad over her left elbow has developed a large, infected, pus-filled swelling.  I'm giving her a hot, epsom salt compress twice a day followed by an anesthetic antibiotic oinment, and an oral antibiotic.  Luckily I went to another vet for a second opinion.  Scott took her to the regular vet (Banfield) yesterday morning, and they wanted to schedule surgery immediately.  I just felt like this was too much too soon without enough information.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;So, I took her to another vet, and, in short, have decided to get rid of my monthly Banfield payment.  She's also going on a diet and exercise program, along with Miranda and myself.  It remains to be seen if Scott will join us.  We are all overweight, and it just needs to be done.  I've been working on my weight in a positive direction, until all this crap yesterday and today, and I want to continue.  Besides, it really is in all of our interests.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;That said, I'm leaving work and headed home to start the walking of the dogs!!!

      So why is it that life becomes so easily boring.  I mean, we have all of these gadgets and gizmos, hundreds of TV stations, plenty of people to talk to, and yet things always seem to resolve into mind numbing boredom.  I'm beginning to think this is just some sort of mildly depressive episode, or at least that's my hope.   I have noticed that a good portion of this is related to work.  Don't get me wrong, I love my co-workers, but I am sick to death of sitting in front of the computer working on mindless projects for my supervisor that won't mean shit to a tree in another week or so.  However, she insists on having all of these data put together so that if anyone ever asks, we'll be able to show them why we made the decisions we made.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;This just pisses me off!  What "we?"  She's my supervisor, and I have to run all decisions through her!  On top of that, she's not even a librarian!  I've spent that past 9 months teaching her about libraries just so that she can make the decisions, or at least the big ones!  For god's sake, I've been doing this for almost 5 years, and have plenty of experience.  In the past, I've been a solo librarian and have had to make all of the decisions.  I've prepared and managed the budget, handled all of the ordering, done all of the document delivery and interlibrary loan, written mission statements, procedures and policies, purchased and managed supplies, done all fo the reference work fielding all manner of difficult to mundane questions, and all to end up at the whims of people who have no clue as to what I do, or even what I'm supposed to do.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;This is without a doubt, the most demoralizing position I've held.  I feel like an adult sent back to kindergarden, and I don't even understand where the mistrust is coming from.  I even ran the library before I was forced under this supervisor.  I'm beginning to think the company has some sort of mandate to keep me under a rock.  I've been trying to reach out and network with the upper management, but that seems to be coming to naught as well.  I just want a position where I can do my thing and use all of the training and experience I've gained over the years, without being forced to hold someone's hand.  My previous two positions had me doing whatever needed to be done, and left all of the decisions to me.  Things worked well, and I was able to accomplish so much.  I've been in this position much longer than either of those, and feel like I've only accomplished half of what I did before.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;This place really needs some serious overhaul of management, and a healthy dose of trust in employees.  Yeah, they're all happy and smiling when talking about the new core mission and values statement, but in the end, it's all a pile of crap.  They don't really care about the employees or how they feel.  Perhaps this is just a problem in the corporate world, but it just amkes you feel useless and limp.  I just keeping telling myself that I get a paycheck every two weeks, and it's big enough to meet my needs, and just shut up and keep going because things have been worse, and . . .
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;But I ramble.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Now for my other career - Anthropology.  I can't say that I found Anthro, but it certainly found me.  It's cost a lot of money, time, blood, sweat, and tears, but now I don't know what to do with it.  I decided not to finish the PhD despite three years investment in coursework.  I just felt, at the end, like I was beating my head against a brick wall.  No one in the department seemed to take much an interest in my research direction, and I quickly found that most of my academic idles had clay feet.  I spent all of my education learning how to do research, with the hallmark being that one wrote an introduction with hypothesis first.  One then proceeded to test the hypothesis to see if the data support the question.  Then, at Indiana University, I found that not only faculty, but also students were fabricating their research hypotheses and introductions long after the data had been analyzed.  While this isn't necessarily complete fraud, I found it somewhat disingenuous at best.  It really is putting the cart before the horse, and in my opinion, flies in the face of scientific inquiry.  For starters, how can you select the appropriate statistical tests without knowing what question you're trying to answer.  But then again, with statistics, if there isn't an appropriate test you simply modify an existing test or create a new one to substantiate whatever your data are telling you, right?  That's been my experience!  I don't put a great deal of stock in anything beyond basic descriptive statistics, although ANOVA and T-Tests aren't all that bad.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Ok, now back from the tangent - where am I now.  Right now I'm teaching a physical anthropology lab at a local community college and finding myself less than excited.  I LOVE teaching, but the subject matter has become somewhat disorganized and uninteresting.  I think I'd be happier teaching a class in cultural anthropology, but then again maybe it's just the student/instructor interaction that I enjoy.  I have always had a good time lecturing to and interacting with my students, no matter the subject.  Right now though, I think I would like to branch out a bit and go beyond all of the phys anth programming into more exciting areas of discourse.  I feel like I have a fairly different take on the educational process than most of my colleagues, and I would like to share that with students.  My basic premise is that students are there to learn, not merely memorize facts to be quickly discarded after the exam.  Therefore, I don't flood them with a mind-numbing amount of facts.  I give them the basics highlighted with key points and ideas, peppered with a wide variety of personal experience and interpretation.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;What I do not do is overwhelm them with information that is more appropriate for students majoring in anthropology who have a need for detailed information to advance them in the discipline.  As for undergraduates, particularly those in introductory classes, I want to make the discipline fun, exciting, and above all interesting.  Nothing kills a discipline more than turning students off.  In fact, the former dean at Florida State who was responsible for the anthropology department hated the discipline.  I found out that the main reason was that he had a terrible experience as an undergraduate and never forgot that bad taste left in his mouth.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I also have a problem with my colleagues who look down upon community college students.  So many of them feel like they are "settling" for having to teach at a CC.  Personally, I have found these students to be as intelligent and as interested as university students.  I can only surmise that my colleagues' view comes from their own warped sense of self-superiority, particularly the ones with PhDs!  I truly feel sorry for them because they are turning off the very people who may have some interest in their futures and the future of the discipline.  At a very basic level the field of anthropology is driven by public funds, and these are the people who, through their judicious exercise of the voting process, elect officials who decide how that money is to be spent.  I can only shake my head at the number of potential supporters who have been driven away because of the careless and harmful handling of the valuable educational process by a group of individuals who see themselves as better than the rest.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Indeed it is the elitist intellectual crowd who cry the longest and loudest about cuts in funding when they themselves have fired the proverbial bullet into their own feet.  Education is changing, and the educators need to realize that relevance is the key to survival.  Yes anthropology is a vital discipline, but it needs to be show as relevant to life for it to survive.  People need to know why it is important to understand evolutionary forces, or why it is important to understand who cultures develop, clash, merge, and change over time.  People need to understand, above all, that the educational process is about learning to think, about how to put ideas together and produce coherent explanations.  Subject matter is secondary to this goal, and it is only through the success of this goal that people will find value in education.  So, to you my colleagues, I say "quit throwing the book at the students.  Give them the framework and the basic data they need to develop their own conclusions.  Help them to understand the main goal of education is how to put two and two together and learn that it equals four.  But more than that, help them to understand why the process is important, and what it means in their daily lives!"
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Ok, enough for today.  I've killed enough time at work, and want to wrap up and head home.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Pax,
      &lt;br /&gt;

      What a bizarre day.  It started off with me feeling out of sorts, and questioning the strange dreams that I've been having lately.  Why is that such abstract experiences have such sway over my emotions.  It made really consider some of the choices that I have made!  Yet I still feel quite sure that I'm on the right path.  All I know is that these feelings, and all of this crap I've been experiencing lately needs to stop.  I need some sort of regular schedule and structure in my life.  I've been trying to find that for so long, but I only seem to be able to maintain such a schedule when I'm in school.  That, however, is not an option as school is too expensive and does not pay enough!
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Last night I was listening to an NPR broadcast on the death penalty for minors, and while I fully believe that anyone capable of committing a crime worthy of the death penalty certainly deserves to be removed from society, it made me think about an earlier broadcast on the fight over displaying the ten commandments.  Why is it that the religious zealots who are trying to legislate their morality fail to follow one of these ten rules set down by their deity.  Unless I'm missing something, or have forgotten my years in church, "Thou shalt not kill" is right up there in the top ten.  How is it that these people who are pressing so hard to display this rule in public places, courthouses in particular, feel that it is so easy to overlook one of the rules and condemn people to death.  Regardless of who carries out the sentence, they are tacitly responsible parties to the killing.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;How then can they sleep at night knowing that they have violated one of the basic tenets of their beliefs as layed down by their creator?
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I guess I just find this all so hypocritical that these people are trying to legislate their own particular version of morality by selectively adhering to portions of the teachings of their deity.  Furthermore, all of these teachings are the recorded words of other MEN who have supposedly been guided by their deity.  And, they have selected only certain of the writings as factual, excluding large amounts of text because they feel it not to be devinely inspired.  So we are left with individuals interpreting the words of other individuals that yet further individuals decided were valid based on completely arbitrary standards, not to mention the fact that all of the words have been translated many time through many different languages from a now defunct language with no extant native speakers to provide interpretations of the subtle nuances present in all languages.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I for one find all of this a bit too much to stomach.  Perhaps they should follow some of the words of their own savior to "judge not lest ye be judged," or to "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."  These are the words that were said, and not merely someone's personal interpretation of what was said.  But then this might completely destroy the fragile exploitation network that many of the more wealthy pracitioners of Christianity have established.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Oh well, just a quick thought on further hypocrisy . . .

    <content type='html'>
      Ok, so I'm sure that folks are just going to rush to see exactly what I have to say.  Actually I doubt many folks will ever see this post, but such is life.  Today feels like something of a new beginning, not just because of the blogging, but just in general.  We rearranged the bedroom/office yesterday, and it feels as if the world has shifted somehow.  Maybe it's just the change in climate here in the IE, but things just feel different.  I know that physically I'm feeling renewed, yet still experiencing the same problems, just from a different perspective.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;I think the Attacking Anxiety &amp; Depression program is really helping.  Things are slightly improved, but the biggest change seems to be my attitude towards things.  I still analyze,  but from a more informed perspective.  Weight and personal image are still a big issue, but I'm working on actually doing something about it.  The biggest challenge is knowing where I have been, what it took to get there, and how hard it will be to get back.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;On a professional level, I still love being a librarian.  I never knew that I would enjoy it so much, but I still can't say that I'm happy where I am.  It's a great job with many freedoms, but the subject simply doesn't interest me.  I hope I will look back on this time positively and realize that I am learning some valuable lessons.
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;Ok, enough for the moment, back to work . . .
