    <summary>The TagLib.NonContainer namespace provides classes for dealing with files that do not have a standardized tagging mechanism and may have any number of tags at their beginning or end.</summary>
    <remarks>The FLAC file format is included in this because despite having a standard tagging mechanism, ID3 and APE tags are not uncommonly attached to the file.</remarks>
