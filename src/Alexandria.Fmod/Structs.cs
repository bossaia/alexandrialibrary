	[STRUCTURE] 
	[
    [DESCRIPTION]
    Use this structure with System::createSound when more control is needed over loading.
    The possible reasons to use this with System::createSound are:
    <li>Loading a file from memory.
    <li>Loading a file from within another larger (possibly wad/pak) file, by giving the loader an offset and length.
    <li>To create a user created / non file based sound.
    <li>To specify a starting subsound to seek to within a multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) when created as a stream.
    <li>To specify which subsounds to load for multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) so that memory is saved and only a subset is actually loaded/read from disk.
    <li>To specify 'piggyback' read and seek callbacks for capture of sound data as fmod reads and decodes it.  Useful for ripping decoded PCM data from sounds as they are loaded / played.
    <li>To specify a MIDI DLS/SF2 sample set file to load when opening a MIDI file.
    See below on what members to fill for each of the above types of sound you want to create.

    [REMARKS]
    This structure is optional!  Specify 0 or NULL in System::createSound if you don't need it!
    
    Members marked with [in] mean the user sets the value before passing it to the function.
    Members marked with [out] mean FMOD sets the value to be used after the function exits.
    
    <u>Loading a file from memory.</u>
    <li>Create the sound using the FMOD_OPENMEMORY flag.
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'length' for the size of the memory block in bytes.
    <li>Other flags are optional.
    
    
    <u>Loading a file from within another larger (possibly wad/pak) file, by giving the loader an offset and length.</u>
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'fileoffset' and 'length'.
    <li>Other flags are optional.
    
    
    <u>To create a user created / non file based sound.</u>
    <li>Create the sound using the FMOD_OPENUSER flag.
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'defaultfrequency, 'numchannels' and 'format'.
    <li>Other flags are optional.
    
    
    <u>To specify a starting subsound to seek to and flush with, within a multi-sample stream (ie FSB/DLS/SF2).</u>
    
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'initialsubsound'.
    
    
    <u>To specify which subsounds to load for multi-sample sounds (ie FSB/DLS/SF2) so that memory is saved and only a subset is actually loaded/read from disk.</u>
    
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'inclusionlist' and 'inclusionlistnum'.
    
    
    <u>To specify 'piggyback' read and seek callbacks for capture of sound data as fmod reads and decodes it.  Useful for ripping decoded PCM data from sounds as they are loaded / played.</u>
    
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'pcmreadcallback' and 'pcmseekcallback'.
    
    
    <u>To specify a MIDI DLS/SF2 sample set file to load when opening a MIDI file.</u>
    
    <li>Mandantory.  Specify 'dlsname'.
    
    
    Setting the 'decodebuffersize' is for cpu intensive codecs that may be causing stuttering, not file intensive codecs (ie those from CD or netstreams) which are normally altered with System::setStreamBufferSize.  As an example of cpu intensive codecs, an mp3 file will take more cpu to decode than a PCM wav file.
    If you have a stuttering effect, then it is using more cpu than the decode buffer playback rate can keep up with.  Increasing the decode buffersize will most likely solve this problem.

		[DESCRIPTION]
		Structure defining the properties for a reverb source, related to a FMOD channel.

		For more indepth descriptions of the reverb properties under win32, please see the EAX3
		documentation at http://developer.creative.com/ under the 'downloads' section.
		If they do not have the EAX3 documentation, then most information can be attained from
		the EAX2 documentation, as EAX3 only adds some more parameters and functionality on top of 
		EAX2.

		Note the default reverb properties are the same as the PRESET_GENERIC preset.
		Note that integer values that typically range from -10,000 to 1000 are represented in 
		decibels, and are of a logarithmic scale, not linear, wheras FLOAT values are typically linear.
		PORTABILITY: Each member has the platform it supports in braces ie (win32/xbox).  
		Some reverb parameters are only supported in win32 and some only on xbox. If all parameters are set then
		the reverb should product a similar effect on either platform.
		Linux and FMODCE do not support the reverb api.

		The numerical values listed below are the maximum, minimum and default values for each variable respectively.

		[REMARKS]
		For EAX4 support with multiple reverb environments, set FMOD_REVERB_CHANNELFLAGS_ENVIRONMENT0,
		FMOD_REVERB_CHANNELFLAGS_ENVIRONMENT1 or/and FMOD_REVERB_CHANNELFLAGS_ENVIRONMENT2 in the flags member 
		of FMOD_ReverbChannelProperties to specify which environment instance(s) to target. 
		Only up to 2 environments to target can be specified at once. Specifying three will result in an error.
		If the sound card does not support EAX4, the environment flag is ignored.

	The step parameter tells the gui or application that the parameter has a certain granularity.<br>
	For example in the example of cutoff frequency with a range from 100.0 to 22050.0 you might only want the selection to be in 10hz increments.  For this you would simply use 10.0 as the step value.<br>
	For a boolean, you can use min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0.  This way the only possible values are 0.0 and 1.0.<br>
	Some applications may detect min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0 and replace a graphical slider bar with a checkbox instead.<br>
	A step value of 1.0 would simulate integer values only.<br>
	A step value of 0.0 would mean the full floating point range is accessable.<br>
